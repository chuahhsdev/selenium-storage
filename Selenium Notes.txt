Which Of The Id, Name, XPath, Or CSS Selector Should You Use?
If the page has unique names or identifiers available, then we should use them.

If they are not available, then go for a CSS selector as it is faster than the XPath.

When none of the preferred locators is present, then you may try the XPath.

What Is XPath? How Does It Work?
XPath is the most-used locator strategies Selenium uses to find web elements.

It works by navigating through the DOM elements and attributes to locate the target object. For example – a text box or a button or checkboxes.
	
Although it guarantees to give you the element you are looking after. But it is slower than as compared to other locators like ID, name, or CSS selectors.

What Does A Single Slash “/” Mean In XPath?
- A single (forward) slash “/” represents the absolute path.
- In this case, the XPath engine navigates the DOM right from the first node.
- /html/body/div/div[2]/input

What Does A Double Slash “//” Mean In XPath?
- A double (forward) Slash “//” represents the relative path.
- In this case, the XPath engine searches for the matching element anywhere in the DOM.
- //div//input[@id=’test’]
